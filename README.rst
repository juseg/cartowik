Cartowik
========

   **Warning**

   Cartowik is no longer developed. This repo has been merged with glacier data
   plotting tool Hyoga_. Cartowik functionality will be released as part of
   Hyoga v0.2.0, and further developed within that project (hyoga issues `#14`_,
   `#15`_, `#16`_, `#17`_, `#18`_, `#19`_). While these two packages had
   different purposes, I tend to use them together, hence my decision to
   continue developing them as a single tool.

Draw Wikipedia_ style location and topographic maps.

Requires cartopy_, matplotlib_ and xarray_.

.. Here come installation instructions after the first release.
   Installation::
   pip install cartowik

See examples directory for practical usage.
